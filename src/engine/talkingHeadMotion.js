// TalkingHead (3D) integration — drives a Ready Player Me / Mixamo-rigged glTF
// avatar. Replaces every 2D SVG MITRA avatar in the app (see TalkingHeadAvatar.jsx).
//
// TalkingHead's own speakText/speakAudio lip-sync expects Google Cloud TTS or
// word-level timestamps, and only ships lip-sync language modules for a handful
// of languages (not Hindi/Tamil/Telugu/... which MITRA speaks via Sarvam). So we
// never call those methods — instead we drive the avatar's viseme blend shapes
// live from the same amplitude-based mouth signal that already animates the 2D
// SVG avatar (subscribeSpeechMotion in speechMotion.js), which works for every
// language and every audio source the app already uses. This is the officially
// documented "direct blend shape control" pattern (TalkingHead README, Appendix F):
// setting `head.mtAvatar[key].realtime` bypasses TalkingHead's own animation/
// smoothing so our values apply immediately, frame to frame.
